### <span class="red">Exploring Deep Mapping Concepts: Crosthwaite's Map and West's Picturesque Stations</span>
#### Alexander Reinhold, Christopher Donaldson, Ian Gregory, and Paul Rayson
What are the requirements for building a historic deep map using literary data? This is the question we sought to address as part of an exploratory prototype in Lancaster University's *Geospatial Innovation in the Digital Humanities: A Deep Map of the English Lake District* project. We created a prototype deep map based on Thomas West's *A guide to the Lakes*, and a historic map of Derwent Water Lake created by Peter Crosthwaite. Our prototype maps the locations of West's picturesque viewing stations and creates connections between the literary work and visual representations of the places described. This article describes our approach to building this prototype and discusses what we learned and the issues we revealed about creating a historic deep map.

### <span class="red">A Spatio-Temporal Linked Data Representation for Modeling Spatio-Temporal Dialect Data</span>
#### Johannes Scholz, Emanual Hrastnig, and Eveline Wandl-Vogt
Collections of linguistic and dialect data often lack a semantic description and the ability to establish relations to external datasets, from e.g. demography, socio-economics, or geography. Based on existing projects - the Database of Bavarian Dialects in Austria and exploreAT! - this paper elaborates on a spatio-temporal Linked Data model for representing linguistic/dialect data. Here we focus on utilizing existing data and publishing them using a virtual RDF graph. Additionally, we exploit external data sources like DBPedia and geonames.org, to specify the meaning of dialect records and make use of stable geographical placenames. In the paper we highlight a spatio-temporal modeling and representation of linguistic records relying on the notion of a discrete lifespan of an object. Based on a real-world example - using the lemma "Karotte" (engl. carrot) we show how the usage of a specific dialect word ("Karottn") changes from 1916 until 2016 - by exploiting the expressive power of GeoSPARQL.

### <span class="red">Considering Identification of Locality in Time. Theoretical and Practical Approach</span>
#### Bogumil Szady and Agnieszka Lawrynowicz
In this paper, we tackle the problem of determining an identity of a locality evolving with time. Firstly, we discuss origins of this problem, namely how it arises in the everyday research practice of historical geographers. Secondly, we present two contexts of emergence of identities: identities embedded in sources and identities constructed in history. Finally, we discuss how such identities may be captured in information systems with the help of state-of-art technologies regarding ontological modeling and reasoning.

### <span class="red">Cadmus and the Cow: A Digital Narratology of Space in Ovid's Metamorphoses</span>
#### Gabriel Viehhauser, Robert Kirstein, Florian Barth, and Andreas Pairamidis
We apply an interdisciplinary methodology to establish a digital-driven narratology of space on Ovid's Metamorphoses. Two approaches are employed: 1. We highlight the importance of nature in the text by exploring the frequencies of architectural and natural terms. 2. We delve into a single episode of the text (Cadmus) by using a collocation-network-approach that reveals the interrelations between characters and settings. We show that the results can feed an analysis in the light of Lotman's model of space semantics.
